<p>Payment plans are offered each semester. If this is the chosen option to pay your tuition, you must enroll electronically each semester. This option is available by logging in to your <a href="http://myusf.stfrancis.edu" target="_blank">MyUSF Portal</a>, clicking For Students, then Tuition Bill/Account Summary, and finally the Electronic Deferment/Payment Plan Enrollment. During the enrollment process you are able to make your first payment with one of four accepted credit cards, or you may choose to mail a check. The cost of the payment plan varies by the program. For our traditional undergraduate students, you may enroll in the 5 payment plan per semester for a cost of $90. For our adult undergraduate and graduate students, you may enroll in the 4 payment plan per semester for a cost of $40.</p>
<p>Accounts that are not paid in full or enrolled in a payment plan by the second published due date of each semester will be assessed a $120 late payment fee, and placed on a business hold. A business hold will prevent future registrations, as well as the release of transcripts or diplomas.</p>

<p>Students whose employer will reimburse the cost of tuition upon completion of courses may enroll in the deferment plan. The deferment plan is only available if your employer will be paying for the tuition. If this is the chosen option to pay your tuition, you must enroll electronically each semester. This option is available by logging in to your <a href="http://myusf.stfrancis.edu" target="_blank">MyUSF Portal</a>, clicking For Students, then Tuition Bill/Account Summary, and finally the Electronic Deferment/Payment Plan Enrollment option on the right side of your screen. During the enrollment process you are able to pay the associated fee to defer your balance with one of three accepted credit cards, or you may choose to mail a check. The cost of the deferment plan varies by the program. For our traditional undergraduate students, you may defer your balance for a cost of $90 per semester. For our adult undergraduate and graduate students, you may defer your balance for a cost of $40 per semester. Students who enroll in the deferment plan have six weeks upon completion of the semester to pay their balance. In the event an employer does not reimburse for tuition, it is the students’ responsibility to make sure all balances are paid in full.</p>
<p>Accounts that are not paid in full or enrolled in the deferment plan by the second published due date of each semester will be assessed a $120 late payment fee, and placed on a business hold. A business hold will prevent future registrations, as well as the release of transcripts or diplomas.</p>

<p>Tuition statements are sent via email to a student’s university email account approximately two weeks before the published due date. Email dates along with due dates are included at <a href="https://www.stfrancis.edu/about/student-accounts/email-schedule-for-usf-tuition-statements/" target="_blank">stfrancis.edu/about/student-accounts/email-schedule-for-usf-tuition-statements/</a>. Students will continue to receive a monthly tuition statement until the balance is paid in full.</p>

<p>Failure to receive your tuition statement does not relieve you of your obligation to pay. Please contact the&nbsp;Student Accounts&nbsp;Office if you do not receive your tuition statement or log into your MyUSF Portal to view your statement.</p>
